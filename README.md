# Fusion 360 to JLCPCB File Converter

A simple, client-side web tool to convert Bill of Materials (BOM) and Component Placement List (CPL) files generated by Autodesk Fusion 360 into the format required for JLCPCB's SMT assembly service.

This tool was created to streamline the process of preparing manufacturing files, eliminating the need for manual CSV editing.

## Features

* **Drag & Drop Interface:** Easily upload your files.
* **Client-Side Processing:** Your files are processed directly in your browser. Nothing is uploaded to a server, ensuring your data remains private.
* **BOM Conversion:** Maps Fusion 360's BOM columns to JLCPCB's required format.
* **CPL Conversion:** Correctly maps columns and intelligently combines separate `_front.csv` (Top) and `_back.csv` (Bottom) layer files into a single, compliant CPL file.
* **Automatic Naming:** The converted files are automatically named for easy identification.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Tool:** Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **BOM File:**
    * Drag and drop your BOM `.csv` file into the "BOM Converter" box.
    * Click the "Convert BOM" button.
    * The converted file (e.g., `jlcpcb_bom_YourFileName.csv`) will be downloaded automatically.
3.  **CPL File(s):**
    * Drag and drop your CPL `.csv` file(s) into the "CPL Converter" box. You can drop a single file or both the `_front.csv` and `_back.csv` files at the same time.
    * Click the "Convert CPL" button.
    * The combined and converted file (e.g., `jlcpcb_cpl_YourFileName.csv`) will be downloaded.

## File Conversion Details

### CPL (Component Placement List)

The tool performs the following transformations on your CPL file(s):

| Fusion 360 Column | JLCPCB Column      | Notes                                                                       |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`              | `Designator`       |                                                                             |
| `X`                 | `Mid X`            |                                                                             |
| `Y`                 | `Mid Y`            |                                                                             |
| *(new column)* | `Layer`            | Set to `Top` for `*_front.csv` files and `Bottom` for `*_back.csv` files. |
| `Angle`             | `Rotation`         |                                                                             |
| *(new column)* | `LCSC Part Number` | Added as an empty column.                                                   |

*All other columns from the original CPL file are removed.*

### BOM (Bill of Materials)

The tool performs the following transformations on your BOM file:

| Fusion 360 Column | JLCPCB Column | Notes                                     |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| `Part`              | `Designator`  |                                           |
| `Value`             | `Comment`     |                                           |
| `Package`           | `Footprint`   |                                           |
| *(new column)* | `LCSC Part #` | Added as an empty column for you to fill in. |

*All other columns from the original BOM file are removed.*
